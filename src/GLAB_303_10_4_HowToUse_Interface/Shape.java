/**
 * In the previous lab (GLAB - 303.10.3), we demonstrated that an
 * abstract class has both methods with bodies, and methods with no
 * bodies (abstract methods). You learned that abstract methods must
 * be overridden in a subclass

/**
 * By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to use Java interfaces.
 * An Interface is similar to an abstract class with no fields and all
 * abstract methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiated â€” they can
 * only be implemented by classes. The purpose of an Interface is to
 * specify behavior for a class.
 * In other words, we can say that an Interface is a design contract. It
 * specifies methods and classes that can "implement" the Interface;
 * and thereby, sign the contract.
 * We will use the Shapes example in this lab.
 * Suppose that our application involves many shapes that can
 * move. We could define an interface as movable, containing
 * the signatures of the various movement methods.
